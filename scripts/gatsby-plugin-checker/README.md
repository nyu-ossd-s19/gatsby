# gatsby-plugin-checker

This script searches the npm API for plugins that start with either "gatsby-source", "gatsby-plugin", or "gatsby-transformer" but don't have the "gatsby-plugin" keyword in their `package.json` and thus are not included in Gatsby's keyword search. The script will then notify those repositories by creating an issue notifying them to add the keyword to their `package.json` (This functionality will be included in the next commit). Once a repo has been notified, its `notified` attribute will be changed to `true` in `plugins.json` and won't be notified. Similarly, if a repo is a false positive or doesn't want to be notified, it can be `blacklisted`.
